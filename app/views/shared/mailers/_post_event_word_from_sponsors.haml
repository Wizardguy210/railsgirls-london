        Brad, from Smart Pension here.
        %br
        Well, that was just a little bit special, wasn't it?  It was both incredible and awesome to be part of such an amazing group of people, both coaches and students. One of my big joys with being in programming is that Engineers have a passion for learning and like to share that knowledge with others!
        %br
        Looking forward to next time, thanks for everyone who made it happen (and Lexie also massively enjoyed herself and learnt a lot)!
