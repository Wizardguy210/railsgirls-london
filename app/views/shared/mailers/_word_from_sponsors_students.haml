          Simply Business is the definition of a challenger brand. As Vice Chairman Jason Stockwood puts it, we are a technology company who happen to sell insurance.
          Insurance is the product and at Simply Business we are obsessed with making the process of finding it as simple as possible for small-medium businesses (SMEs), without compromising on choice, quality or cost. SMEs account for 99% of all UK businesses with a combined annual turnover of ¬£1.9 trillion.
          %br
          We've created a unique, digital marketplace for small business insurance, challenging a traditional industry on behalf of over 600,000 customers and going from startup to half-billion dollar company in just over a decade.
          %br
          Simply Business technology is famed for harnessing cutting-edge data ability, our belief in experimentation, learning to fail, and building our own technology to deliver better experiences for customers and employees.
          %br
          Our applications are built using Ruby and Ruby on Rails, React, Redux, Javascript, Python, and Scala, with some others in the mix.
          They sit on top of different databases like MongoDB, Redis, MySQL, and testing frameworks like RSpec, Jasmine, and Jest. Glueing all this together, we rely on Kafka, Puppet, and AWS, among others.
          Our people work in offices in London, Northampton and Boston, USA (and every remote or smart-working desk in-between) and are united by our mission - to create something better, to support the success of small businesses, to enable our people to thrive and have a positive impact on the world.
          In 2017, Simply Business earned the right to Benefit Corporation (B Corp) status. This recognises our strong track record of having a positive impact on people, society and the environment. Having also won back-to-back awards as the Sunday Times Best Company to work, we continue to look for ways to improve - right now we are focusing on employee mental health, customer empowerment and charitable activities.
          Simply Business parties are famous. In fact, we‚Äôre just back from a two-day company awards holiday in Paris (last year it was Barcelona). But more so is our passion for building technology which is as innovative today as it will be reliable tomorrow, enabling the world‚Äôs best commercial insurance experience.

          We are a technology led company, working in an industry that previously didn't welcome technology.  While our competitors may take months to ship new code, with our TDD approach and focus on quality, we are continuously shipping new features, over 20 times a day!

          We believe that a diverse and inclusive workforce, is the most awesome workforce and we work in a collaborative team environment with all members treated equally, no matter their seniority, when it comes to reviewing PR‚Äôs and building software.
