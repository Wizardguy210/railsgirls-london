        We've attached a welcome note from our host Deliveroo with some details about the venue and event.
      %p
        Since Deliveroo  is letting us use their offices, we've been kindly asked to sign a short NDA. Everyone will need to sign it on the day. We have attached it to this email, so you can read it before coming on Friday.
      %p
        Please make sure to read through  both attachements :)
      %p
        Please remember to bring with you
        %b a printed or digital version of the confirmation email, your laptop, and your ID (to prove you are over 18). Attendees under 18 must be accompanied by an adult.

      %p
        %strong See you at the workshop!
